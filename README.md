# STEM kiosk project

## Roadmap
- stemkiosk: screencast videos to demo arithmetic and other topics in jupyter notebooks and as `.cast` ASCII casts
  - [ ] create a github org account
  - [ ] create a youtube channel
  - [ ] create content
  - names:
    - **stemkiosk**
    - stemnotebooks
- curriculumtool: curriculum graph tool for coverage
  - create and validate YAML-LD files for each curriculum item
    - create new from template
    - spec: schema.org classes and properties
      - schema.org/CreativeWork
      - schema.org/name
      - schema.org/educationalAlignment
      - schema.org/about
  - example:
    - adding numbers in notebooks ex:depends_upon how to create a notebook
    - how to create a notebook ex:depends_upon / ex:is_satisfied_by / ex:is_covered_by:
      - create a notebook in jupyter notebook
      - create a notebook in jupyter lab
      - create a notebook in colab
      - create a notebook in vscode
      - create a notebook in vscode.dev
      - create a notebook from markdown with jupytext
      - create a notebook from python with jupytext
  - generate reports from the graph nodes and edges:
    - graph traversals through the topologically-sorted curricula items
    - video playlists
    - combined video sequence(s) that inductively present the material
      - e.g. a transitive sort with `tsort` should present the requisite
        material first, if there are enough edges between the
        curriculum items

### screencast recording setup
  - create a screencast user
  - create a screencast container or vm
  - set the screen resolution and font dpi
  - record browser interaction test cases with:
    - selenium ide, TODO [...]
  - generate a screencast script from a test case
    - manual script for human to record with human typing speed
    - automated script with random typing speed variation
    - titlecards and any other hints for editing
  - add text titlecards
  - generate description of video from curriculumtool metadata
  - zoom in and out
  - display touch and click events:
    - android: default screen recorder
  - display key pressed events:
    - linux: screenkey
  - OBS: Open _ Studio
    - video bitrate:
      - youtube video upload bitrate recommendation: 20000 ?
  - asciicinema or similar
    - ascii terminal session replay
    - probably similar to notebooks for same,
      so maybe useful for getting the tutorial concepts written in code somewhere
- manim-jupyter-simulator
  - generate a manim Python script to replay a notebook in a manim video

## Use Cases, User Stories, Why
- Teach Computer Math, Coding, and STEM at a Science Fair -style event
  - Passive Video
    - Play a Video on repeat on a spare TV
    - Play a Video playlist on repeat on a spare TV
    - Play a Playlist of youtube videos on repeat on spare TV
      - show the shorturl of each video as a subtitle
  - Active Interaction
    - Jupyterlite in a browser tab that gets closed and re-opened after
      a period of inactivity
    - Jupyter in a container that gets shutdown and recreated from a
      container image after a period of inactivity
      - This is how Google Colab and BinderHub and github.dev
        (and gitpod, devpod, kasm,) work
      - BinderHub: User clicks a 'launch in Binder' badge image,
        container is created in the cloud (repo2docker) with everything
        installed,
        the user is logged in and redirected to Jupyter notebook or
        JupyterLab running in the container.
        for the user from a git repo, and then logs them into the
        container, and when it times out, the container is destroyed
      - Github.dev, gitpod etc; basically the same thing
      - https://mybinder.org/ works)

## CurriculaGraph

- Tools
  - Notebooks: Create a notebook in {JupyterLite, Colab, vscode.dev,}
  - Python: Arithmetic in Python
  - Git: Learn git with learngitbranching.js.org

ViM (Vi-iMproved) is an open source programmers' text editor written in C
that's available on very many platforms.

* Vim help can be accessed with `:help` and `:help help`
  (Press `<esc>`, Type `:help help`, Press Enter)
* Vi is almost always installed on Linux and BSD boxes.
* Vi is often included with Busybox.
* Vi and Vim are installed with OSX.
* Vi and Vim are installed by default on many Linux
  Distributions.
* Vim runs in a terminal, over SSH, and with a GUI window manager
  (Gvim, Macvim)
* Vim configuration is written in the vim language.
* Vim reads a few vimrc configuration files in sequence (`:help vimrc`)
* GVim is Vim for Gnome window manager
* GVim reads a few vimrc configuration files in sequence (`:help gvimrc`)
* MacVim is Vim for OSX
* One way to write changes and exit vim: `:wq!`
  (Press `<esc>`, Type `:wq!`, Press Enter)
* There are many plugins for vim.
* NERDTree is an example of a vim plugin:
  https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree (`:help nerdtree`)
* SpaceVim and westurner/dotvim include the NERDtree plugin
* Vim keyboard shortcuts are calling mappings.
* Vim mappings are defined in a vimrc file.
* Examples of vim mappings:
  `\e` opens NERDTree, `\E` opens NERDTree to the current file
* Vim mappings can be defined for different vim modes:
  `:map \e` (command mode), `:imap \e` (insert mode) (`:help modes`)
* Press `i` or `a` while in command mode to enter
  insert or append mode (`:help vim-modes`)
* Press `<Esc>` to return to command mode

Browser extensions with vim-style keyboard shortcuts:

* Vimium (Chrome)
* Vimperator (Firefox)
* Wasavi (Chrome, Opera, Firefox)

A number of web apps support vim-style keyboard shortcuts
like `j` and `k` for up and down:

- GMail (`?` for help)
- Facebook (`?` for help)
- X (`?` for help)
- GitHub (`?` for help, `<Esc>` to close help)

Games with support for vim-style keyboard shortcuts:

- vimtutor: `:e $VIMRUNTIME/tutor/en/vim-01-beginner.tutor`
- https://vim-adventures.com/

IDEs with support for vim-style keyboard shortcuts:

- vscode, https://vscode.dev/, https://github.dev/, gitpod, devpod, code-server
- jupyterlab, jupyterlite
- colab
- neovim
- vim
- vi (busybox (initrd,))

How to access help in vim:

- `:help` -- open help in a split (`<Esc>`, then `:help`, then **Enter** (`<CR>`); `:q` to close)
- `C-w-j` -- focus a window down ((`<Esc>` to exit insert or append mode), then `<Ctrl><w> <h/j/k/l>`; `:map <C-W>J`)
- `Ctrl-]` -- follow (help,) link under cursor
- `Ctrl-O` -- go back
- `Ctrl-I` -- go forward

Devcontainer Features:

- Devcontainer Features are composable; you can add multiple features to a `devcontainer.json`.
- Devcontainer Features split configuration that can be just one `Dockerfile` into many JSON & `Dockerfile`s.
- An SBOM tool could discover the versions of software installed in a devcontainer
  by: instructions in the devcontainer.json, instructions in the Dockerfile, Devcontainer Features,
  or other.

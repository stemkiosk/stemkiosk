- Devcontainer Features split configuration that would be in just one Dockerfile into many JSON and Dockerfiles.
- An SBOM tool could discover the versions of software installed in a devcontainer
  by: instructions in the devcontainer.json, instructions in the Dockerfile, Devcontainer Features,
  or other.
